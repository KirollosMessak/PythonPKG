ðŸ”¹ ci.yaml (For Testing & CI) â€“ Minimal Edits
This file is mostly standard.

You only modify dependencies and test commands.

ðŸ“Œ What to Edit?

python-version: Change to match your project (e.g., "3.8", "3.11").

requirements.txt: Ensure the dependencies are installed correctly.

pytest (or your test framework): Modify if using unittest, tox, etc.

ðŸ”¹ python-publish.yml (For Deploying to PyPI) â€“ Minimal Edits
Mostly standard but requires your PyPI API token.

GitHub Actions encrypts the token, so you donâ€™t hardcode it.

ðŸ“Œ What to Edit?

Ensure PyPI API token is stored in GitHub Secrets (secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN).

Python version (if needed).

Run commands (modify twine commands if needed).

Trigger event (modify release: types: [created] if you want a different trigger).
